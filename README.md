Step number the first- make sure Java is in your path, you can check this by opening command prompt and running java -version
it should display a version number, if it's not then

Hit the Windows Key and type "Path" then click the first option most likely "Edit system enviroment variables or paths"
Then click "Enviroment Variables" click on "Path" then click "Edit" next click "Browse" and look under Program Files\Java\jdx-x.x.x\bin then click Ok. Click okay till the Path dialogue is closed. Great, now open cmd and type java -version. If it worked you'll see version information if not, DuckDuckGo-san could help. 

Next, CD to where the "Main.java" is located and type "Java Main.java"

Done.
